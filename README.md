## Contributing to the source code

### System prerequisites

-   [nvm][1]
-   [docker][2]
-   [vscode][3] (recommended)

### Recommended Tools

A database managment tool such as [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for inspecting the database.

<br />

### 1. Install dependencies & setup

-   for client, `cd client && nvm use && npm install`
-   for server, `cd server && nvm use && npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

### 2. Setup environment settings for the server

#### .env

`cd server && npm run copyenv`

### 3. Startup (local)

For quick start with [itermocil][3] from the root, run `npm start`.

Otherwise, for:

-   client -> `cd client && npm start`
-   server -> `cd server && npm run start:debug`
-   services (database, mailcatcher) -> `cd server && npm run start-services`

```bash
cd client && npm start # To start the frontend
cd server && npm start:debug # To start the backend
cd server && npm start:services # To start the nest application

# wait until nest app is running
cd client && npm run codegen # To generate graphql stuff
cd server && npm run codegen # To generate graphql stuff
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

#### Database migrations

Once the server is running, migrations can be run with the following command:

`cd server && npm run mikro:migration:up`

##### Resetting

If the migration:up command above is erroring, or if you need to start from a fresh state, run `cd server && npm run mikro:migration:fresh`. This script will also trigger the initial seed mentioned below.

##### Creating

-   To create a blank migration run `cd server && npm run mikro:migration:create`.
-   To create a migration for the schema diff, run `cd server && npm run mikro:migration:generate`.

In the migrations folder, edit the auto generated name to include a description of the migration's purpose. Formation should be `Migration*timestamp*-description-of-migration-purpose.ts`

##### Seeding

If you don't have a production db dump & would like to seed the db with a root user & bisc organization, run `cd server && npm run initial-seed` which will:

-   create a test user with `root@bisc.nl` as email/username & `password` as password
-   insert postal codes needed for language house use

### Database dump and restore

Before dumping and restoring, make sure your local database container is running. This allows you to use its pg_dump and pg_restore commands. This has no relation to your running database: the arguments control where from/to the data is dumped/restored. Run your local container by running:

    $ cd server
    $ npm run start-services

The container's name should be `bisc-top_postgres_1`.

#### Dump command

The `/backups` directory in this repository is gitignored, so you can use that directory to keep your database dumps.

For remote dumps:

    $ docker exec -i bisc-top_postgres_1 pg_dump --host=[hostname] --username=[db-username] -v -Fc [db-name] > backups/[date]-[env].dump

For local dumps:

    $ docker exec -i bisc-top_postgres_1 pg_dump --username=postgres -v -Fc bisc-top > backups/[date]-local.dump

The password of the local database can be found in `/server/.env`.

#### Restore command

Please note: the `-c` arguments cleans the database before restoring.

For remote restores:

    $ docker exec -i bisc-top_postgres_1 pg_restore --host=[hostname] --username=[db-username] -c -v --no-owner -d [db-name] < [source-dump-file]

For local restores:

    $ docker exec -i bisc-top_postgres_1 pg_restore --username=postgres -c -v --no-owner -d bisc-top < [source-dump-file]

### Deployment

Deployments are done through Lifelyâ€™s internal CI/CD pipelines via Jenkins. For further insight into the configuration and the triggered tasks, refer to the devops directory. If you need a version deployed to any of the live environments, contact ops or the team leads.
